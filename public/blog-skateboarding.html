          <h2>Types of Skateboarding</h2>
          <p>Skateboarding is diverse, with different styles suited to different preferences and skill levels:</p>
          
          <div class="article-subsection">
            <h3>Street Skating</h3>
            <p>Street skating involves performing tricks on urban landscapes using stairs, rails, ledges, and other street features. This style emphasizes technical tricks and creative use of the environment. Street skaters typically use smaller boards with higher concave for better flip control.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="article-subsection">
            <h3>Cruising</h3>
            <p>Cruising is the most accessible form of skateboarding, perfect for beginners. It involves riding smoothly on flat ground, ideal for transportation or leisurely rides. Cruiser boards are wider and more stable, making them comfortable for long distances.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="article-subsection">
            <h3>Vert Skating</h3>
            <p>Vert skating takes place on halfpipes and bowls, where skaters ride back and forth on vertical ramps. This style requires significant skill and generates impressive air tricks. Professional vert skaters compete in major competitions worldwide.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="article-subsection">
            <h3>Downhill Racing</h3>
            <p>Downhill racing involves speed on steep hills, making it one of the most thrilling forms of skateboarding. Riders use specially designed boards and protective gear while reaching high speeds.</p>
          </div>

        <section class="article-section">
          <h2>Essential Skateboarding Techniques for Beginners</h2>
          
          <div class="article-subsection">
            <h3>Pushing</h3>
            <p>The foundation of skateboarding is learning to push. Stand on the board with your dominant foot near the back, while using your other foot to push against the ground. Keep your body relaxed and use smooth, rhythmic pushes to maintain momentum.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="article-subsection">
            <h3>Turning</h3>
            <p>Turning is accomplished by shifting your weight and applying pressure to either the heel or toe side of the board. For beginners, practice gentle turns on flat ground before attempting turns at higher speeds.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="article-subsection">
            <h3>Stopping</h3>
            <p>There are several ways to stop: the most common for beginners is the tail drag, where you apply pressure to the back of the board with your pushing foot to create friction. As you progress, you can learn the power slide for more controlled stops at higher speeds.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="article-subsection">
            <h3>Ollie</h3>
            <p>The ollie is the fundamental trick that enables all modern skateboarding tricks. By snapping the tail of the board against the ground while pulling your front foot upward, you can make the board pop into the air. Mastering the ollie opens the door to endless trick possibilities.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="article-subsection">
            <h3>Balance and Positioning</h3>
            <p>Proper balance is crucial for skateboarding. Keep your knees slightly bent for better shock absorption and stability. Your shoulders should align with your feet, and your core should be engaged throughout your ride.</p>

          <h2>Getting Started: Tips for Beginners</h2>
          
          <div class="article-tips">
            <div class="tip">
              <h4>1. Invest in Quality Gear</h4>
              <p>Start with a decent quality skateboard suited for beginners. A complete setup typically costs between $80-$150. Don't overlook safety equipment: a helmet, wrist guards, knee pads, and elbow pads are essential to prevent injuries.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
              <h4>2. Wear Protective Equipment</h4>
              <p>Even experienced skaters fall. Protective gear is non-negotiable for beginners. A helmet can save your life, and wrist guards prevent common wrist fractures.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
              <h4>3. Start on Flat Ground</h4>
              <p>Begin your skateboarding journey on smooth, flat surfaces away from traffic and obstacles. Empty parking lots or skateparks with flat areas are ideal for practicing basic skills.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
              <h4>4. Practice Regularly</h4>
              <p>Consistency is key to improvement. Even 30 minutes of practice several times a week will yield noticeable progress. Set small achievable goals, like maintaining balance for longer or perfecting your pushing technique.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
              <h4>5. Learn From Others</h4>
              <p>Join local skateboarding communities, watch tutorial videos, and don't hesitate to ask experienced skaters for advice. Many skate parks have welcoming communities eager to help newcomers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
              <h4>6. Be Patient With Yourself</h4>
              <p>Progress takes time. You might feel wobbly at first, but with consistent practice, your balance and confidence will improve. Celebrate small victories along the way.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
              <h4>7. Choose the Right Skateboard</h4>
              <p>Different boards suit different styles. For cruising and learning basics, choose a cruiser or standard street board with medium flexibility. Avoid boards that are too small or stiff for beginners.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip">
              <h4>8. Understand Skateboard Maintenance</h4>
              <p>Keep your board in good condition by regularly checking your bearings, tightening bolts, and cleaning your grip tape. Proper maintenance extends your board's lifespan and ensures optimal performance.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Your Skateboard Components</h2>
          <p>To maintain and choose the right skateboard, it's helpful to understand the different components:</p>
          
          <ul class="article-list">
            <li><strong>Deck:</strong> The wooden platform you stand on, typically made of 7-ply maple wood</li>
            <li><strong>Grip Tape:</strong> Sandpaper-like surface on top of the deck providing traction for your feet</li>
            <li><strong>Trucks:</strong> Metal components that connect the wheels to the deck and allow for turning</li>
            <li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Made of polyurethane in various sizes and durometers (hardness levels)</li>
            <li><strong>Bearings:</strong> Small metal balls inside the wheels that determine speed and smoothness</li>
            <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Bolts and screws that hold the truck to the deck</li>
            <li><strong>Riser Pads:</strong> Optional spacers between deck and trucks to prevent wheel bite</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section">
          <h2>Skating Spots and Community</h2>
          <p>One of the best aspects of skateboarding is the vibrant community that comes with it. Skate parks are welcoming spaces where you can practice, meet other skaters, and improve your skills surrounded by inspiring riders. Many parks offer sessions for different skill levels, making them perfect for beginners.</p>
          
          <p>Beyond official skate parks, look for smooth, flat areas in your community where you can practice safely. Local spots like empty parking lots, basketball courts, or designated skate areas provide excellent practice opportunities.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section">
          <h2>Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
          
          <ul class="article-list">
            <li><strong>Buying the Wrong Board:</strong> Choosing a board that's too small or too stiff makes learning harder. Consult experienced skaters or staff at skate shops for recommendations.</li>
            <li><strong>Skipping Safety Gear:</strong> Many beginners think they won't fall, but falls are part of learning. Always wear protective equipment.</li>
            <li><strong>Progressing Too Fast:</strong> Trying difficult tricks before mastering basics leads to frustration and injuries. Build your foundation first.</li>
            <li><strong>Poor Posture:</strong> Slouching or leaning too far forward or backward destabilizes your ride. Maintain proper balance and alignment.</li>
            <li><strong>Neglecting Maintenance:</strong> A well-maintained board is safer and performs better. Regular maintenance prevents equipment failure.</li>
            <li><strong>Fear-Based Decisions:</strong> It's normal to be nervous, but excessive fear prevents progress. Start small and build confidence gradually.</li>
          </ul>
