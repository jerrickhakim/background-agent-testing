          <h2>The History of Skateboarding</h2>
          <p>Skateboarding originated in the 1950s in California when surfers wanted to "surf" on land. They attached roller skate wheels to wooden boards and began practicing maneuvers on the streets. The sport quickly evolved, with the first commercial skateboards appearing in 1959. The 1970s brought innovations like urethane wheels and the modern skateboard design we know today.</p>

          <h2>Why Skateboarding is More Than Just a Sport</h2>
          <p>Skateboarding is a lifestyle, a form of self-expression, and a way to push creative boundaries. It's about freedom, creativity, and the pursuit of progression.
